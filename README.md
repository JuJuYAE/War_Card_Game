# War_Card_Game
In this game, two players are dealt cards (the entire deck of cards) and will start to compare values of each card they possess. If the value of player 1's card > value of player 2's card, player 1 takes both cards and vice versa. If both cards drawn are of equal values, both players will draw 3 and compare the last one. This game goes on until one player has 0 cards left. 


This was a project I was able to achieve while completing my bootcamp from Udemy taught by Jose Portilla ("The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero")
